# Sparsity Final Assignment

First, run ``requirements.txt``.

Then, run the ``generate_Ws.ipynb`` file. This will generate the required W and noise matricies needed for the code. 

The primary file to examine is ``project_v2.ipynb``. There you can find the implementation of the Generative Prior Method following Bora et. al. 2017's paper and the Pure Generative Approach which we developed. For the LASSO method and results, please see the ``lasso.ipynb`` file.


The final report and presentation can be found in ``DataComp_Assignment_Final.pdf`` and ``Sparsity_Presentation_Final.pdf``, respectively.
